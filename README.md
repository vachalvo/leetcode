<h1 align="center">Welcome to LeetCode Tracker üëã</h1>

> This repository is to keep my progress in LeetCoding.

I will be updating this repository with my solutions to the problems at LeetCode.

## Introduction to LeetCode
[![LeetCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/LeetCode-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=LeetCode&logoColor=#d16c06)](https://leetcode.com/)

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of more than 3000 questions, code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly. It is a great platform to practice coding and improve your problem-solving skills.

## üìÅ Folder Structure
The repository is structured in the following way:
- Each problem is in a separate folder.
- Each folder contains the problem statement in the `problem.md` file.
- The solution to the problem is in the `solution` file.
- All problem folders are sorted by their problem number. (so that it is easy to find a problem by its number)

## üíª Language
I solve the problems mainly in the following languages:
